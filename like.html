      <h2>Coding~</h2>
      <p>
      I like spending some of my free time trying to learn new languages and playing around with them.
      Although sadly, these few days when I'm in school, most of my coding invlove working on projects for class :(.

      <h2>My Girlfriend &lt 3</h2>
      <p>
      Honestly, I been spending some seriously unhealthy amounts of time with her, but I love it! She has been been supporting me in my ups and downs with pretty much everything in my life. I can't even being to state how much joy I've had with her. Pretty much every great moment of my college life has included her. She pretty much just makes my life so much better in so many ways.

      <p>
      So what do I do in my spare time? Well, I actually go this (sorta) bad habit of watching a LOT of TV (while I multi-task and play on my phone simultaenoulsy cause i'm just that good). <br> <br>Some of the best TV's i've come across are SUITS (WHO ELSE HERE IS A SUITS FAN?) and the old classic Friends! Of course,there are many, many more awesome series that I should mention, but it's late and I'm too lazy to :P
