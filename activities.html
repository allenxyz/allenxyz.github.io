			<h2>Kick-ass taekwondo</h2>
			<p>
			Another big part of my life is my extra curicculars. I've been doing taekwondo for maybe over a decade now. Although, only after joining UM Takewondo and competing against princeton and cornell, have I realized how much I have yet to improve in taekwondo. 
			Currently I'm one of the head instructors in UMTKD.
			Fun fact, I'm actually certified as a taekwondo referee!

			<h2>Piano    &#9834&#9835</h2>
			<p>
			Piano has been a hobby for quite a while. although my mother forced me to play piano from a young age, and now I'm pretty good.
			<br>
			Though I am really out of practice, due to the lack of pianos in the engineering school, and also my lack of motivation to get out of the house to find one :P.
